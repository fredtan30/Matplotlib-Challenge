The Power of Plots - Analysing the treatment using variant drugs for mouse tumor

1. Identify any duplicate time points of the mouse ID and remove any data associated with that mouse ID
    - Read the Data
    - Combined the data between mouse data and study results
    - Used the duplicated() function in finding duplicate ['Mouse ID', 'Timepoint']
    - Combined all the duplicated data with the Mouse ID
    - Used the drop() function to remove all the duplicated data
    - Display the clean Data
2. Generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen
    - Calculating the mean, median, variance, std_deviation and sem value by Tumor Volume
    - Merge all values into a new dataframe and display the merge data
3. Preparing Bar Chart and Pie Chart using pandas and pyplot
4.
